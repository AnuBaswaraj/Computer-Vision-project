there was some distortion in the image while changing the background.
so, i dilated the edges. as the number of iterations increase distortion of object decreases.

for the video, i did the same as that of image except few changes in code like reading the frames of video etc.

the output video is little bit delayed, and sometimes just gets stuck but you can resume the video by pressing space bar for some reason that i dont know.
you may have to play the original video in the background as well while viewing the final video after the code.

please press and hold space bar for the video to be played.
